Efficiency Score Calculator Δ (v1.0)


This C program is a personal habit tracker that evaluates daily discipline and computes a weekly Efficiency Score.

Daily habits and priorities are connected to programming logic to make this project a practical application of C language.

Features
Tracks a 5-day weekly routine

Scoring is based on the following parameters:-
1. Workout
2. Studying
3. Punctuality 
4. Screen time
5. Sleep discipline

Points are awarded for positive habits, with penalties applied in case of failure.
The daily scores are stored in an array.
 Efficiency Score(Δ) is calculated and printed at the end.

The program uses functions to maintain clarity.
1. getYesNo() - Manages a yes or no based Input
2. WeeklyScore() - Displays the scores of the week
3. Efficiency_Score() - Calculates Efficiency Score using the formula

      Efficiency Score (Δ) = (Sum of Daily Scores / Maximum Possible Weekly Score) × 100

Purpose

This project was built as a personal life-efficiency system, combining self-discipline with academic learning.
 Negative scores are allowed, reflecting real-life consistency rather than artificial scoring.
Future versions may extend this to multi-week tracking and averages.
